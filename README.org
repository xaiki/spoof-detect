#+TITLE: Spoof Detect

Detect spoofed website by detecting logos from bank and financial entities in
pages with =ssl certificates= that do not match.

The process is pretty simple:
 - [1/2] scrape gvt websites to get a list of entities.
   - [x] ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·  BCRA
   - [ ] other countries 
 - [x] get logos, names and url
 - [x] navigate the url, extract the ssl certificate and look for =img= and tags
   with =id= or =class= logo (needs more heuristics) to make a db of logos
 - [x] screenshot the page and slice it into tiles generating YOLO annotations for
   the detected logos
 - [x] augment data using the logos database and the logoless tiles as background images
 - [x] train yolov5s
 - [x] feed everything to a web extension that will detect the logos in any page and show a warning if the =SSL certificate= mismatches the collected one. (this is actually a bit hacky, as yolov6 has A LOT of postprocessing and i can't be bothered to reimplement it all in JS for TSJS to work, it currently relies on a rather hackish local deamon written in python)

* running
#+begin_src sh
  # build the training dataset
  docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans -d
  docker-compose exec python ./run

  # run the training on your machine or collab

** augmentation
there were a lot of augmentation solutions out there, because it had better
piplines and multicore support we went with:
